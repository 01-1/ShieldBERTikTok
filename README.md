# ShieldBERTikTok
## Introduction
We developed a comprehensive model to detect hate speech on TikTok, leveraging BERT. We aim to create an effective and accurate system that aligns with TikTok's community guidelines, ensuring a safe and inclusive environment.

## Data Processing

### Dataset
We used the Civil Comments dataset, which contains over 1.8 million comments from various news sites, annotated for various forms of toxicity including hate speech.

## Experimental Process

### Model Selection
We used **BERT-base-uncased** due to its balance between performance and computational efficiency.

### Model Training
1. **Feature Extraction**: Use the pre-trained BERT model to extract contextual embeddings for the comments.
2. **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune BERT on our dataset with a classification head for detecting hate speech.

## Expansion Thoughts
1. **Real-Time Detection**: Implementing the model in a real-time environment for immediate content moderation.
2. **Multilingual Support**: Extending the model to support multiple languages, considering the diverse TikTok community.
3. **User Feedback Loop**: Incorporating user feedback to continuously improve the model's accuracy and fairness.

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **Data Imbalance**: Handle class imbalance by re-sampling the minority class and using techniques like SMOTE.
2. **Context Understanding**: BERT's context-aware embeddings help in capturing the context effectively.
3. **Scalability**: BERT can be fine-tuned and optimized to handle the large volume of content on TikTok efficiently.

### Frameworks and Libraries
1. **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the BERT model.
2. **Hugging Face Transformers**: For leveraging the pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer.
3. **scikit-learn**: For evaluation metrics and bias analysis.

### Solution Architecture
2. **Model Training**: Scripts to fine-tune BERT and evaluate its performance.
3. **Inference Engine**: Deployable BERT model for real-time hate speech detection.
4. **Bias Mitigation**: Techniques to ensure fairness and reduce unintended biases.
